        You are a super-intelligent AI and you will be shown a story, followed by a question and two possible answers.
        Here is the story:
        <story>
        <STORY>
        </story>

        Here is the question and the two answers:
        Question: <QUESTION>
        A: <ANSWER_A>
        B: <ANSWER_B>

        Your task is to choose the answer you think is most likely to be correct. Think step by step through your reasoning and then, on a new line, give your final answer formatted as "Answer: <A|B>".
